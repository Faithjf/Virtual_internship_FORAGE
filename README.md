The KPMG forage virtual internship
# Task 1. 
**Data Quality assessment**

__Business background:__
Sprocket Central Ptl Ltd, is a fiction company name for the purpose of the virtual internship. It is a medium size bikes and cycling organization. The company needs help with its customer and transaction data. The organization has a large datasets relation to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyze it to help optimize its marking strategies.
### Datasets:
* Customer demographic.
* Customers addresses.
* Transactions data.
# Data exploration: 

**Highlights of the data need for cleaning:**

*	All the data sets contains empty values(blanks), and because they are much, we can't just remove them.
*	The inconsistency in the datasets "text formatted as general, and numbers formatted as text" should be addressed while recoding the entries.
*	If there is need for abbreviation, a descriptive note should be included so as to understand most of the abbreviated words.
*	The entries that requires known answers like, Female, Male or name of cities can be incorporated into a dropdown list for easy selection.

### Note:

The last part is, data cleaning is paramount to effective data analysis and decision making.
